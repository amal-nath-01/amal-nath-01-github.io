## About Me

Hi! I'm **Amal Nath**, a postdoctoral researcher at the **Department of Biomedical Engineering, Lund University, Sweden**.  
My research focuses on **lab-on-a-chip systems**, particularly **acoustofluidics and acoustic particle manipulation**. I design, develop, and validate microfluidic platforms for clinically relevant applications, such as blood plasma separation.  

I have experience in computational modeling with **MATLAB** and **COMSOL Multiphysics**, microfluidic design in **Autodesk Fusion 360**, and fabrication using **micromilling** and **3D printing**. My work spans engineering design, experimental validation, and clinical assessment.
